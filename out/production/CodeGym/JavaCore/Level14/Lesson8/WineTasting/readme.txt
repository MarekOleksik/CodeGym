1. Create an abstract Drink class with an implemented public void taste() method that displays "Delicious".
2. Create a Wine class that inherits Drink and implements a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "Birthday".
3. Create a SparklingWine class that inherits Wine and implements a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "New Year's".
4. Write implementations for the getDeliciousDrink, getWine, and getSparklingWine methods.
5. All the classes must be in separate files.

Wymagania:
•	The abstract Drink class must be in a separate file.
•	The Drink class must implement a public void taste() method that displays "Delicious".
•	The Wine class must be in a separate file and be a descendant of the Drink class.
•	The Wine class must implement a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "Birthday".
•	The SparklingWine class must be in a separate file and be a descendant of the Wine class.
•	The SparklingWine class must implement a public String getCelebrationName() method that returns "New Year's".
•	The Solution class must implement the getDeliciousDrink() method, which returns a Wine object.
•	The Solution class must implement the getWine() method, which returns a Wine object.
•	The Solution class must implement the getSparklingWine() method, which returns a SparklingWine object.
