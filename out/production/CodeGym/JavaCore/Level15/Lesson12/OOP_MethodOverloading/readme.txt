1. In the Tree class, overload the info(Object s) method twice to get three methods: info(Object s), info(Number s), and info(String s).
1.1. Study the info(Object s) method. Create similar functionality in the new methods.
1.2. For example, the result for the info(Number s) method might be "Tree No. 123, Number method, Short parameter".

Wymagania:
•	The Tree class must implement the info(Object s) method.
•	The Tree class must implement the info(Number s) method.
•	The Tree class must implement the info(String s) method.
•	The info(Number s) method should display a line similar to the line for the info(Object s) method, replacing only "Object method" with "Number method".
•	The info(String s) method should display a line similar to the line for the info(Object s) method, replacing only "Object method" with "String method".
