1. Figure out what the program does.
2. Implement logic in the printCountdown method so that every half a second the program displays an object from the variable list. The output should be in reverse order: from the index passed to Countdown down to zero.

Example:
Index 3 is passed

Example console output:
Line 2
Line 1
Line 0

Wymagania:
•	The printCountdown method should run for about half a second.
•	The printCountdown method should reduce (decrement) the value of the variable countFrom.
•	The printCountdown method must display the list item with an index equal to the new value of countFrom.
•	The main method must create a Countdown object.
•	The program's output must match the example in the task conditions.
