1. Figure out what the program does.
2. Correct the takeOff method. It currently takes a looooong time. A takeoff should take 100 milliseconds.
3. Implement the waitForTakeoff method by analogy with the takeOff method. The wait time should not be longer than the takeoff time.

Wymagania:
•	The takeOff method should run for approximately 100 ms.
•	The waitForTakeoff method should run for approximately 100 ms.
•	The main method should create 3 planes.
•	The Solution class must have an inner class called Plane.
•	The Solution class must have an inner class called Runway.
