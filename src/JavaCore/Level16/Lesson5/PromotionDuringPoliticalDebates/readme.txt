1. Figure out what the program does.
2. We need to be sure that Chump talks the most during the political debate.
3. Think about what method you can call on the chump object to make Chump talk until all the available time has been taken.

Wymagania:
•	Call the join method on the necessary object.
•	The Politician class's toString method should display how many times the politician spoke, for example: "Chump spoke 35 times".
•	The program should create 3 Politician objects.
•	Don't change the methods that are responsible for screen output.
•	The program's output should indicate that Chump spoke the most during the political debate.
