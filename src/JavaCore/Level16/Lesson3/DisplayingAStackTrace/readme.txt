1. Create a "task" (a public static class called SpecialThread that implements the Runnable interface).
2. SpecialThread should display its own stack trace.

Hint: The main thread already displays its stack trace.

Wymagania:
•	Add a public static class called SpecialThread to the Solution class.
•	The SpecialThread class should not inherit any additional class.
•	The SpecialThread class must implement the Runnable interface.
•	The SpecialThread class's run method should display its own stack trace.
