Simplify the code:
- remove everything that will be generated automatically by the compiler
- remove all class inheritance that will be added automatically by the compiler
- remove all constructors that will be automatically created and added.

Wymagania:
•	The Car class should not have explicit no-argument constructors.
•	The Machine class should not have explicit no-argument constructors.
•	The Car class must be a descendant of the Machine class.
•	The code should not have explicit inheritance involving the Object class (extends Object).
•	The Car class should not explicitly inherit the Runnable interface.
