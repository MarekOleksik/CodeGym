1. In the Solution class, create 4 constructors with different access modifiers.
2. In a separate file, create a SubSolution class and make it a child of the Solution class.
3. In the SubSolution class, use the Alt+Insert -> Constructors command to create constructors.
4. Correct the SubSolution constructors' access modifiers so that there are 3 constructors with different access modifiers (all except private).

Wymagania:
•	The SubSolution class should have 3 different constructors.
•	The Solution class should have 4 different constructors.
•	The Solution class must define constructors with all possible access modifiers.
•	The SubSolution class must define constructors with all possible access modifiers except private.
•	The Solution class must be the parent of the SubSolution class.
